## Project 5: Predicting employee total compensation

**Problem statement:** Predict employee total compensation based on their professional features (job role, years of experience, etc.), their company and office features (company, office location) and macro-economy features (inflation rate, employment rate)
* Goals:
    1. Provide employees with a reasonable expectation for compensation negotiation
    2. Provide companies an important benchmark for the talent competition, i.e., how much to offer to stay competitive in recruiting
    3. Identify the important features that determine the total compensation, including the company, job role, office location, employeesâ€™ experience, and macro-factors such as employment rate and inflation rate.  
    
The success of the project is measured by the accuracy of the total compensation prediction, i.e., the difference between the actual and the predicted compensation.
